For this assignment I used my own css codes to create the webiste as bootstrap is very annoying for me to use, but for now its okay. The errors for deploying and mongodb was extremely annoying so i had to go back in the lectures and notes from the lectures
to figure out what was wrong wiht it in the same place, majority of my code came from my past assignments in this class and the usage of lecture notes. Addionally i used the html, css, javascript, webistes linked by the prof for learnign as guide
database connection issues were many in this assignment, as render is a linux servcie so some codes did not work as intentented but that issue was fixed. The code was done through me and no online resources were used except
the ones i noted above and i will post the links below.
